# Web Stack Outage Postmortem: Service Degradation and Downtime

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 15, 2023, 08:00 AM - June 15, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC-5)
Impact: Web Application Service
During the outage, users experienced intermittent connection issues and slow response times, with approximately 30% of the user base being affected.

Timeline:

08:00 AM: The issue was detected by an engineer who noticed a spike in error logs and an increase in customer support complaints.
Actions Taken: The investigation focused on the web application servers, network infrastructure, and database.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths: Initially, the team suspected a database performance issue and spent considerable time optimizing queries and database connections, but this did not resolve the problem.
Escalation: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team and the senior engineering manager for further assistance and coordination.
10:30 AM: The incident was resolved, and the service was restored to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the web stack outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an uneven distribution of incoming requests among the application servers.

To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:

The misconfiguration in the load balancer was rectified, ensuring that incoming requests were evenly distributed across the available application servers.
The load balancing algorithm was optimized to dynamically adjust the distribution based on server load and performance metrics.
Additional monitoring and alerting were implemented to promptly identify and address any future load balancing issues.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues and improve the overall stability of the web stack, the following measures will be implemented:

Regular load testing and capacity planning exercises to ensure the infrastructure can handle expected user loads.
Improved monitoring and alerting mechanisms to quickly detect anomalies and performance degradation.
Implementation of automated configuration management to prevent misconfigurations in critical components.
Enhanced incident response protocols, including clear escalation paths and communication channels.
Conducting post-incident reviews to identify and address any gaps in the incident response process.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Review and update load balancer configurations across all environments to ensure consistency and proper load distribution.
Conduct thorough load testing on the web application to validate its performance and capacity.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide better visibility into load balancer performance and potential misconfigurations.
Automate load balancer configuration management to minimize the risk of human error.
Update incident response plans to include specific procedures for load balancing-related incidents.
Schedule regular post-incident review meetings to analyze and document lessons learned from this outage.
Conclusion:
The web stack outage was caused by a misconfigured load balancer, leading to uneven distribution of incoming requests and subsequent service degradation. By promptly identifying and resolving the root cause, as well as implementing corrective and preventative measures, we have taken significant steps to enhance the stability and performance of our web application. Through continuous improvement and rigorous monitoring, we aim to provide our users with a seamless experience while ensuring the reliability of our services.
